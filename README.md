# Too Hype To Handle, A Bipolar Two Survival Game: 

### App Demo: https://cmcaplinger.github.io/projects/

---

## Concept:

Manage your mental health in this 'Tamagotchi' style game focused on Bipolar II. It is a simulation based on what it's like to live with Bipolar Two. Players can perform various actions - sleep, eat, indulge, exercise, work - and see the affect on their mood. Bipolar Two is a mood disorder characterized by periods of depression and hypomania. Depressive symptoms may include loss of interest, weight changes, fatigue, feelings of guilt, decreased ability to think, sleeping too much, and suicidal ideation and actions. Hypomanic symptoms may include increased energy, insomnia, risky behavior like hypersexuality and addictions, exaggerated self-confidence, and racing thoughts. After periods of hypomania, people often experience an intense emotional crash. Effects of the player's choice are reflected in the mood status bar. Actions will preserve the player's mental health status as baseline - or push the player into either a depressive or hypomanic mood. Depending on what mood the player is in, their action choices may be limited. Goal one of this application is to gamify the process of healthy living and mood disorder management. The second is to foster empathy and provide perspective for people without a mood disorder.

#### User stories

As a player I will see a Start Button and Rules Button on the first page that I can click. The rules button will reveal the game instructions. From both the first page and rules page I can opt to start the game. Once I start the game I want to see how I can interact through buttons and directions. I will see buttons that are actions I can perform

#### Development Plan 

First I did Use Case Scenarios and Specifications, then mocked out some wireframe elements. I established the CSS early, so that I could just focus on JQuery functionality.

## Challenges:

Functioning if statements that were based on CSS properties. Just some syntax stuff that took a while to figure out.
